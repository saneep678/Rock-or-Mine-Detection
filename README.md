# Rock-or-Mine-Detection
This project focuses on classifying underwater objects as either 'Rock' or 'Mine' using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of sonar signals, and two models—Logistic Regression and Random Forest—are used for classification. Feature preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation were conducted to determine the best classifier. Results indicate that Random Forest performs better in accuracy compared to Logistic Regression. This study demonstrates the potential of ML in sonar-based object detection.
