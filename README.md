# Rock-or-Mine-Detection
This project classifies underwater objects as 'Rock' or 'Mine' using sonar signals and machine learning. Logistic Regression and Random Forest models were trained and evaluated. Results show that Random Forest outperforms Logistic Regression in accuracy, highlighting the potential of ML for sonar-based object detection.
